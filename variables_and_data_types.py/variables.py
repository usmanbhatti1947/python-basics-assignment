# Variable is a location to store data in memory

# declared as 
# x = 4

# to comment a line used # key

# valid way to declare a variable not to use number or special char 
# could be camel case or lower case best practice is
# my_variable

# value swap without using 3rd variable
# x,y = y,x

# immutable refers to object whose state cannot be modified after declaration
my_string = "Hello"
# my_string[0] = "h"
# Error should be like below
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
# print(my_string)

my_tuple = (1,2,3)
# my_tuple[0] = 4
# Error should be like below
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# print(my_string)

my_number = 10
# mutable, can change value
my_number += 5
# print(my_number)

message = ("Hello python world!")
